# SDN controller for 'Radio' (SDN-R)

SDN-R adds features and functionality to the OpenDaylight-based ONAP controller 'SDN-C'. It is built on the Common Controller Framework to control and manage wireless resources. Wireless resources are virtual network functions (e.g. vBBU, vEPC) or physical network functions (e.g. microwave and millimeter wave radios, eNodeB, RRH, DAS equipment).

SDN-R is integrated into ONAP. Therefore it is interfacing with PNFs and VNFs and with other ONAP components, such as A&AI, DCAE and SO.
