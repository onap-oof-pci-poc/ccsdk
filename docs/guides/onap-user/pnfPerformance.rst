Performance Monitoring
======================

Performance Monitoring values measured by the devices are necessary to
analyze and optimize the network. Therefore the application
automatically retrieves all historical performance values from the
devices and stores them in a data base. The client part just retrieves
the values from the database and displays them in graphical and/or grid
views.

Current performance values
--------------------------

After selection of a connected PNF supporting ONF-TR-532 and an physical
interface, the application collects the current performance values
directly from the device and displays then in table views.

Performance history values
--------------------------

After selection of a connected PNF supporting ONF-TR-532 and an physical
interface, the application collects the received and centralized stored
performance values for this interface and displays then in table views.

Performance link values
-----------------------

After selection of two air-interface creating an air-interface-link, the
application collects the received and centralized stored performance
values for this link and displays the data in diagrams and table views.
