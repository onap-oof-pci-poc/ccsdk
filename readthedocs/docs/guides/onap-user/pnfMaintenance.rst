Maintenance Mode
================

The 'Maintenance' application on the OpenDaylight provides the
information of the Network Elements which are set for Maintenance,
currently or in the future.

When a Network Element is mounted with the maintenance mode it
automatically shows on this application with the Information like when
maintenance will be started or ended.

Maintenance Mode field in this application shows if the Network Element
is in maintenance mode currently or not. If it is True it means the
Network Element is currently undergoing maintenance, If false it means
maintenance might have been set for future or maintenance is already
completed.

Users have access to disable the Maintenance mode or change the
maintenance start and end dates at any point of time by clicking on the
Manage checkbox available.
